A naive graduate student from Xidian University (西安电子科技大学 in China) attempting to come up with a theory that explains how intelligence derives itself from bit. 

Specifically, much of my endeavor is payed to understanding the internal mechanism of deep learning models, though I have absolutely no resources and support. I got enough Nvidia Cards :) 

Currently I am working on the basic theory of Information Bottleneck and on some papers about Information Plane, wishing to get some clue from information theory perspective.

I am also quite interested in representation learning ideas, especially about how structure and content identify objects together.  

tough work, but still breathing :)
